			<div id="about">
				<p>For my MSc project I have written some software that generates short stories. The stories aim to have a dark and dreamlike theme, taking inspiration from authors and creators like David Lynch, David Foster Wallace and Haruki Murakami among others.</p>
				<p>The stories all feature two characters interacting with one another, whilst events happen around them. The stories aren’t generated with an end goal in mind, rather with a relaxed set of constraints ranging from Markov chains, naive character motivations, knowledge of previous stories and randomness. The hope is to strike a balance between software that generates rigid narratives within a clearly defined domain (like <a href="https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/57816/TR186.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank">a murder mystery</a> or <a href="http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewFile/2250/2101" target="_blank">King Arthur's Knights</a>) and narratives generated by <a href="https://arstechnica.co.uk/gaming/2016/06/sunspring-movie-watch-written-by-ai-details-interview/" target="_blank">recurrent neural networks</a> (or similar systems)<sup data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Such as sitcom episodes written by tensorflow.">1</sup> that are perhaps <a href="http://www.thereforefilms.com/uploads/6/5/1/0/6510220/sunspring_final.pdf" target="_blank">too close to gibberish</a><sup data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Although I am a fan of Sunspring, click the link to the left for the  screenplay.">2</sup> for many creative standards.</p>
				<p>The goal is for the stories to replicate some of the style of magic realist or surrealist authors and auteurs, who demonstrate a high level of creativity. At present the vignettes are generated using characters and events based on Twin Peaks and Welcome to Nightvale (as they had wikipedia lists of episodes I could programmatically turn into story elements.) but the knowledge base of story components could be expanded in the future or replaced with data from any genre.

			<a onclick="toggleHelp();" style="cursor:pointer" class="text-center"><h3>How Can You Help?</h3><p><small>click to show/hide section</small></p></a>
			<div id="help">
				<p>I'm asking for some really simple feedback on a selection of the stories the software has generated.</p>
				<p>I'd particularly like to know how creative you think the output is (<a onclick="showHideDefinitions();" style="cursor:pointer">Here are two definitions of creativity that can guide you</a>).</p>

				<div id="definitions1" hidden="true">
					<blockquote>
						<p>The ability to produce original and unusual ideas, or to make something new or imaginative.</p>
						<footer><cite><a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/creativity" target="_blank">Cambridge Dictionary</a></cite></footer>
					</blockquote>
					<br>
					<blockquote>
						<p>The ability to transcend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, relationships, or the like, and to create meaningful new ideas, forms, methods, interpretations, etc.; originality, progressiveness, or imagination.</p>
						<footer><cite><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/creativity" target="_blank">Dictionary.com</a></cite></footer>
					</blockquote>
				</div>

				<p>I’m also asking if you liked or enjoyed the story, this is primarily to separate your opinion about whether creativity is being demonstrated from any other value judgements about the quality of the text (if you don’t like the material the stories are based on you might not enjoy any of them).</p>
				<p>The stories presented are made with varying levels of constraints in place, which strongly dictate the output. There are about 24 stories to rate, and they are all presented as short vignettes, so it shouldn’t take too long (I expect about 20-25 minutes) to evaluate them all. I don’t expect you to spend any more than a couple of seconds on answering the two questions about each story.
				</p>

				<p>Thanks for your help,<br>Lewis.</p>
